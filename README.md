First Repository for storing any ideas/code

Hello everyone,
Vithushan here, I am a new to programming and coding in general. At the moment, I am trying to get myself familiar with Java, Python and Java Script. I am hoping to put any skills I've learnt from my self-learning to use in any projects to familiarise myself with concepts.
